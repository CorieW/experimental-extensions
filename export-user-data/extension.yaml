  - param: STORAGE_BUCKET
    label: Cloud Storage bucket for images
    description: >
      To which Cloud Storage bucket will you upload images that you want to resize?
      Resized images will be stored in this bucket. Depending on your extension configuration,
      original images are either kept or deleted.
      It is recommended to create a separate bucket for this extension. For more information,
      refer to the [pre-installation guide](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/storage-resize-images).
    type: string
    example: my-project-12345.appspot.com
    validationRegex: ^([0-9a-z_.-]*)$
    validationErrorMessage: Invalid storage bucket
    default: ${STORAGE_BUCKET}
    required: true

  - param: CLOUD_STORAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY
    label: Folder for storing exported data
    description: >
      To which Cloud Storage folder will you upload exported data?
    type: string
    required: true


  - param: FIRESTORE_PATHS
    label: Cloud Firestore paths
    description: >-
      Which paths in your Cloud Firestore instance contain user data? Leave
      empty if you don't use Cloud Firestore.
      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID
      of the deleted user with `{UID}`.
      For example, if you have the collections `users` and `admins`, and each
      collection has documents with User ID as document IDs, then you can enter
      `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.
    type: string
    example: users/{UID},admins/{UID}
    required: false

  - param: SELECTED_DATABASE_INSTANCE
    label: Realtime Database instance
    description: >
      From which Realtime Database instance do you want to delete user data?
    type: string
    example: my-instance
    validationRegex: ^([0-9a-z_.-]*)$
    validationErrorMessage: Invalid database instance
    required: false

  - param: RTDB_PATHS
    label: Realtime Database paths
    description: >-
      Which paths in your Realtime Database instance contain user data? Leave
      empty if you don't use Realtime Database.
      Enter the full paths, separated by commas. You can represent the User ID
      of the deleted user with `{UID}`.
      For example: `users/{UID},admins/{UID}`.
    type: string
    example: users/{UID},admins/{UID}
    required: false

  - param: STORAGE_PATHS
    label: Cloud Storage paths
    description: >-
      Where in Google Cloud Storage do you store user data? Leave empty if you
      don't use Cloud Storage.
      Enter the full paths to files or directories in your Storage buckets,
      separated by commas. Use `{UID}` to represent the User ID of the deleted
      user, and use `{DEFAULT}` to represent your default Storage bucket.
      Here's a series of examples. To delete all the files in your default
      bucket with the file naming scheme `{UID}-pic.png`, enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png`. To also delete all the files in another bucket
      called my-app-logs with the file naming scheme `{UID}-logs.txt`, enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt`. To *also* delete a User
      ID-labeled directory and all its files (like `media/{UID}`), enter
      `{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt,{DEFAULT}/media/{UID}`.
    type: string
    example: "{DEFAULT}/{UID}-pic.png,my-awesome-app-logs/{UID}-logs.txt"
    required: false

  - param: SEARCH_FUNCTION
    label: Search function URL
    description: >-
      Specify a function URL to call that will return a list of queries that can used to delete user data.
