# Using the extension

Uploade images to the storage bucket which the extension was configured to monitor. The file with extracted text will appear in the same folder after a second.

# Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
